# Telemedical-Analysis
Here we vow to analyze datasets related to diseases and study and predict the outcomes of it using different ML models. This would ensure we understand the accuracy of our choice of the model(s) we implement to visualize the data.
The idea of remaining healthy and fit plays a significant part in human life. It’s one of the main factors that lead to a happy life. But in today’s world getting prone to diseases is quite common due to various factors like an increase in the stress level in our day-to-day life, not getting enough sleep, not maintaining a proper diet, and many other indirect factors. But it is observed that people tend to neglect these diseases or symptoms or don’t bother about them because of their busy schedules. In several cases, this negligence leads to more severe. So treating every disease is very important.
Considering today’s fast-growing life, the need for such types of projects is much more than anything else because we humans tend to care a lot less about our health which in some ways or the other return to haunt us in our lives. Besides these, the medical infrastructure in most places is not fully developed or absent. For example, people in rural areas often don’t get proper medical facilities or have any knowledge about what disease they are affected by. Another chunk of our society consists of people (in the age group of 60+) considered senior citizens. For them, this is no more than a lifeline. Getting every minute details about a disease along with the associated treatments just by inputting the details of symptoms from their home, along with the additional facilities of consulting doctors, and getting medicines with just a few steps is helpful and time-saving.
